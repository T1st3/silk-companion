## Description
The FamFamFam Silk icon set is a very large, consistent set of well-drawn icons that has proven to be popular with both applications and web sites.

On a number of occasions I have found myself wanting more icons in the same style. This companion set represents what I needed but also what I felt like adding.

Some are new icons in the same style, some are alternative sizes/colours of the existing icons and some are new compositions of the elements.

## CSS spritesheets
You can insert the icons directly into your HTML with a common IMG tag:

```
    <img alt="Connect" src="dist/png/folder_connect.png" width="16" height="16">
```

In addition to the icons by themselves, this project also ships a CSS spritesheet for the icon-pack. This spritesheet allows to load the entire icon-pack in just 1 image, and thus reduce HTTP calls.

This is what it actually looks:

![Spritesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damieng/silk-companion/master/dist/sprite/silk-companion.png)

All the positioning of the icons inside this alone image is made through CSS, which allows you to just add block-type tags with the proper class and get the same result:

```
    <div class="silk-companion folder_connect"></div>
```

Just remember to add the CSS stylesheet to the HEAD of your HTML page!

## Packages

## Build (the whole project or your custom project)

We use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build the project, so if you want to re-build or customize this project, you'll need Gulp.

After gulp is installed, and your CLI is pointed to your work directory, first install the dependencies:

```
     npm install
```

then, you can run the `gulp build` task to build the project:

```
     gulp build
```

## What the build task does

First, it takes PNG files from the `src` folder, and pastes them to the `dist` folder.

Then it creates a spritesheet from the PNG images located in the `src` folder, and thus creates the `sprite` folder in `dist`.

If, for example you just want `bell_silver` and `page_break` icons in a spritesheet, you just have to fork this project, point your CLI to the working directory, empty the `src` directory, except `bell_silver` and `page_break` icons, and then run the `gulp build` task.

You'll get the proper spritesheet and copies of the icons directly in the `dist` folder.
